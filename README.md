# AlarmClock Project

## Overview
The **AlarmClock Project** is a JavaScript-based project that showcases a clock functionality with alarm capabilities. This project is designed in two versions:

1. **AlarmClock**: Displays time and alarm functionalities directly in the console.
2. **AlarmClockV2**: Enhances the project with an interactive HTML and CSS-based user interface.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, private methods, and encapsulation, with the use of ES6+ features in JavaScript.
